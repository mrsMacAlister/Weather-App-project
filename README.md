# Weather-App-project
**Vanilla JS - APIs**

A Weather App created with JavaScript, integration of OpenWeather API and Geolocation API, and Bootstrap for responsiveness.
The app shows current time, weather and a 5-day forecast at the default city, user's current location or at the location the user searched.
